# ANA 600 – Fundamentals of Analytics

**Author:** Randall C. Crawford

This repository contains coursework completed for **ANA 600: Fundamentals of Analytics** at National University. The course focused on building a strong foundation in **statistical modeling, data analysis, and analytical reasoning**, with an emphasis on applying statistical methods to real-world data problems.

Over the duration of the course, the work involved:

* Exploratory data analysis of **continuous and categorical variables**
* Application of **descriptive and inferential statistics**
* Statistical modeling and evaluation of **regression-based models**
* Error analysis, model interpretation, and result validation
* Translating analytical results into clear, defensible conclusions

The assignments emphasized **hands-on analysis**, problem formulation, and interpretation of results rather than automated or black-box modeling. Tools and methods were selected to reinforce fundamental statistical concepts and sound analytical practice.

This repository reflects applied analytical work completed in alignment with the course learning objectives and serves as evidence of foundational competency in analytics and statistical models.
